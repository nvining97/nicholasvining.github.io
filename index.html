    <p>This is Pokemon Odyssey. A remake of Pokemon containg several of the Pokemon regions created with textures from Pokemon Platinum/Diamond/Pearl. I decided to rebuild Pokemon in java and build the code the entire engine myself. To do this I am using LibGDX, a gaming framework library.  </p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The game focuses on the main story from the original game, Pokemon Red/Blue, whith Team Rocket as the antagonist, and your goal to become the pokemon league champion. For every region I add, I will also add that regions corresponding antagonist group. storyline, and characters. I also hope to add special episodes with more story related exploration and battles that enrich the story further.</p>
